# assignment_data_structures
Buckets and buckets of data!

[A Ruby-based data structures assignment for the Viking Code School which uses arrays, hashes, linked lists, structs, graphs and trees](http://www.vikingcodeschool.com)

Warmup: Big O

1. Accessing an item by index in an array.

Constant time O(1), finds item by simple addition and multiplication to find value. It's independent of data size.

2. Unshifting a new item into the beginning of an array.

Linear time O(n), due to the fact you have to rebuild the entire data set again without the value selected for deletion because arrays are continous chunks of memory.

3. Pushing an item onto the end of an array.

Linear time O(n), same as unshifting a new array is created in memory to add new value. 

4. Upcasing a string

Linear time O(n), you have to iterate through each char in the string and change it.

5. Reversing a string

Linear time O(n)
